# Almost Isosceles Pythagorean Triples Optimizer

This repository contains an optimization algorithm for generating almost isosceles Pythagorean triples, starting from the triple (3, 4, 5). The algorithm, implemented in `AIPT_generator.py`, uses a specific method to update the values of x and y, which are then used to calculate the triples. 

## Installation

To use the optimizer, simply clone the repository to your local machine and run the `AIPT_generator.py` script. 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/abhrankan/almost-isosceles-pythagorean-triples.git
cd almost-isosceles-pythagorean-triples
python AIPT_generator.py
```

## Usage

The optimizer allows you to specify the number of triples to generate. Simply run the script and enter the desired number when prompted. The script will then generate and display the almost isosceles Pythagorean triples.

## Contributing

If you have ideas for improving the optimizer or want to report a bug, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
